How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To understand and interpret a user needs a good way to begin is with the system analysis. This can happen if you ask for feedback from the previous users and covering modification within the code. The outputs and the inputs done for the system, should be found. The user story allows for users to express there needs/wants. This tool is usually used within the Agile development. This gradually gives a betterunderstanding of what the user wants so that we may adhere to there needs.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
